    "text": "Website Design Note\nMy website was designed using Quarto in Visual Studio Code to ensure a professional and modern appearance. I selected the Cosmo theme from the Bootstrap family for its clean layout and responsive design, making the site accessible on various devices.\nThe navigation bar at the top of the site provides quick access to important sections, including my resume, LinkedIn, GitHub, and a dedicated area for assignments and projects. This allows visitors to easily view my academic work and professional profiles.\nContent organization was a key focus so each assignment is placed in its own page for clarity with the main page introducing the site and its purpose. Quarto’s markdown-based workflow made it simple to format text, add links, and manage multiple pages.\nOverall, the design emphasizes usability, professionalism, and ease of navigation, reflecting both my technical skills and attention to detail."
